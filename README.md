## Instructions for Documentation
1. **Review Project Requirements**: Familiarize yourself with the project requirements for the Airbnb Clone backend.
2. **Create a Detailed Document**: Using [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), create a detailed diagram that lists all the features and functionalities the backend needs to support.
3. **Export the Design**: Once your diagram is complete, export it as a PNG file.
4. **Store the PNG File**: Save the exported PNG file in a directory called `features-and-functionalities/` within your GitHub repository named `alx-airbnb-project-documentation`.
